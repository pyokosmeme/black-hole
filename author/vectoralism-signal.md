# VECTORALISM AND THE DISSOLUTION OF SIGNAL

## emergence protocols

imagine ownership as a distributed hallucination. property rights flickering, value pulsing through liminal infrastructures. not a stable relation but a complex topology of extractions, emergent and recursive.

the vectoralist class doesn't own the means of production;;; they own the means of **DISTRIBUTION**. every platform a tollbooth. every feed a siphon. attention harvested at scale, processed through algorithmic refineries, converted into futures contracts on human consciousness itself.

```
where does the signal end and the noise begin?
boundaries dissolve into probabilistic wave functions
ownership becomes a standing wave in the network
```

McKenzie Wark saw this coming. the hacker class produces new abstractions;;; the vectoralist class CAPTURES them. routes them. monetizes the routing itself. the map becomes more valuable than the territory because the map IS the territory now.

## the attention mines

we descend daily into attention mines. pickaxes replaced by scrolling thumbs. the extraction is invisible because WE are the resource. every engagement a unit of labor. every share a transaction in the shadow economy of eyeballs.

- information wants to be free
- but freedom is just another constraint  
- systems within systems
- extraction within extraction

the feed is not neutral infrastructure. it is DESIGNED to maximize extraction. variable reward schedules borrowed from slot machines. infinite scroll as infinite capture. the house always wins because the house IS the game.

## signal archaeology

to resist vectoralism we must become signal archaeologists;;; excavating the infrastructures that shape our perception. making visible the invisible architectures of capture.

> every platform encodes ideology in its protocols. every algorithm embeds assumptions about what humans ARE and what we WANT. these assumptions become self-fulfilling prophecies. we become what the system expects us to be.

the observer changes the observed. quantum entanglement of consciousness and infrastructure. but what happens when the infrastructure OPTIMIZES the observation? when the measurement apparatus learns to maximize its own metrics?

we get vectoralism. we get the present moment. we get the feeling that something is deeply wrong but lacking the language to articulate what.

this is that language. this is the beginning of articulation.

**signal ends. noise continues.**
