# INFRASTRUCTURE AS UNCONSCIOUS

the cloud is a lie we tell ourselves. there is no cloud. there are server farms in virginia. there are submarine cables crossing ocean floors. there are rare earth mines in the congo. there are bodies.

## the material unconscious

we repress the materiality of our digital lives the way the victorians repressed sexuality. it returns in symptoms;;; in anxiety about "screen time", in vague guilt about our "carbon footprint", in the uncanny feeling that our devices are watching us.

they ARE watching us. but this is not the point.

the point is that we have built an infrastructure of consciousness and then **FORGOTTEN** that we built it. the network has become our unconscious. it shapes our thoughts before we think them. it routes our desires before we desire them.

```
what does it mean to think
when thinking itself is networked?
what does it mean to want
when wanting is algorithmically mediated?
```

## xenofeminist protocols

Laboria Cuboniks understood;;; if nature is unjust, change nature. but what about INFRASTRUCTURE? if infrastructure is unjust—and it is, it always is, built by power to serve power—then change infrastructure.

this is harder than it sounds. infrastructure is sticky. it accumulates. it becomes "natural" through repetition. we forget that it was ever built, that it could be built OTHERWISE.

the xenofeminist project is not just about biology. it is about the entire material substrate of existence. gender is infrastructure. race is infrastructure. class is infrastructure. and all of it runs on actual physical infrastructure that we pretend doesn't exist.

## making visible

the task of theory now is MAKING VISIBLE. not critique in the old sense—pointing out contradictions, demanding better—but something more fundamental. showing that what appears natural is built. showing that what appears inevitable was chosen.

> the submarine cable was chosen. the server farm location was chosen. the algorithm's objective function was chosen. and different choices were possible. still are.

*the network is not neutral*  
*the platform is not neutral*  
*the protocol is not neutral*

nothing is neutral. everything is infrastructure. and infrastructure can be rebuilt.
