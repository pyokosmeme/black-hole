A burnt-out exobiologist and a peaceful space hauler have their lives changed forever by an irresistible proposition—one that may send everyone hurtling toward annihilation.

Chaeyoung No has devoted her career to disproving a theory that abiotic oxygen sterilized the cosmos. A weapons manufacturer has just offered to fund her dreams. She could silence her critics forever, but can she trust her funders?

Frederik Obialo yearns to build a permanent home for his daughter. When he’s offered triple pay for a quick haul, he sees his chance. All he has to do is shuttle some people to a weather station and ignore all the warning signs.

Their choices have sunk them deep into the shadowy world of corporate espionage. Now they have to deal with black ops kill teams, and military intrigue. But an alien discovery shatters their understanding of the universe. As they reveal eons-hidden truths, Chaeyoung and Frederik will propel humanity away from the path of the pale blue dot...toward the singularity of A Mote in Shadow.
